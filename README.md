# Usage:

This is a batch file that can download the passwords of all the wifi networks that the computer has the passwords to. To use, simply press the green code button on the top right corner and then press download the zip file. Once the download has finished, extract the files. Among the files is test.bat, which is the file we are gonna run for the extraction of the passwords. Now we must take a flash drive and copy the virus.bat file to the root folder.

Now we are ready to start stealing the passwords. With the flash drive go to any computer and plug it in, then run that same code that will download a few XML files and then unplug the flash drive.

These XML files contain all the password of the corresponding wifi&#39;s. The 3rd line gives us the name of wifi such as: \&lt;name\&gt;This\_is\_the\_wifi\_name\&lt;/name\&gt; and the password will be in the 22nd line under key material, such as: \&lt;keyMaterial\&gt;This\_is\_the\_password\&lt;/keyMaterial\&gt;.

Voila!
